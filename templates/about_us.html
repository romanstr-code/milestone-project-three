                     <p class="light">Our story goes back around 20 years.Armed with a passion for coffee, we had a
                         vision to create The Best
                         Brazilian Coffee Shop across Ireland. We started off simply trying to make a few local
                         independent coffee houses
                         work. And they did! We are 100% independent.Since opening weâ€™ve been recognised and won twice
                         in the Westside
                         Restaurant and Bar Awards. Centrally located and inside the stunning surrounding of City
                         Center, we are the perfect
                         escape for those wanting Quality Coffee, signature cakes, lunch or a perfect place to meet up
                         with friends ! </p>

             <!-- Quality/Consistency Division -->
             <div class="col s12 m4">
                 <div class="icon-block">
                     <h2 class="center orange-text lighten-1"><i class="fas fa-user-check"></i></h2>
                     <h5 class="center">QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY</h5>

                     <p class="light">Making great coffee takes some doing. So we partnered with a small Brazilian Farm.
                         We open our
                         Roastery,and we developed special Blend Coffee that is exclusive just to 60MlsCoffee. Regularly
                         we invent new Blends
                         and impress our Coffee Shop Quests with new Coffee Sensations.</p>

                     <h5 class="center">Our Roastery</h5>

                     <p class="light">Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green coffee
                         beans into roasted
                         coffee products. The roasting process is what produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by
                         causing the green
                         coffee beans to change in taste.</p>
